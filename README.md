### Matlab syntax:
```
[Pout, Puni, numObjEst] = CLEAR(Pin, numSmp, numAgt)
```

### Description:
``[Pout, Puni, numObjEst] = CLEAR(Pin, numSmp, numAgt)`` applies the CLEAR algorithm on the aggregate association matrix ``Pin`` and returns the cycle consistent association matrix ``Pout``. Variable ``numAgt`` is the number of views or agents, and ``numSmp`` is a vector that contains the number of observations at each view. CLEAR further returns lifting associations to universe ``Puni`` and the estimated size of universe ``numObjEst``.  


### Example:
Run "Example.m" for a simple example that shows how the CLEAR algorithm is called.


### Options and tips: 
If the number of objects is known, call the algorithm with the option
```
Pout = CLEAR(Pin, numSmp, numAgt, 'numobj', numObj)
```
where ``numObj`` is the number of objects. Otherwise, the algorithm automatically estimates the number of objects from the spectrum of the normalized Laplacian matrix.
